The main idea behind this project is to reduce carbon footprint emission and implement a worldwide cooperation of people, with a interest based on renewable energy or products like the recycled plastics but not limited to.

To change how things are normally done, we need to have another approach of the actual problem. Think twice, think renewable energy, think of a new eco-system, think of reducing emission, think of a better world... How do we solve this problem or what could be done to achieve this. 

Everyday, severals workers are needed to repair broken road or pave new one, sidewalk, outdoor space and play area. Most of the time, this require many differents heavy machinery, specialised worker, tons of chemicals on site, and what we want to avoid or reduce, carbon emission footprint.

 ## This project could be beneficial in many way :
 _Here is some of the steps that could drastically change the eco-system and recude carbon emission over a long period of time._

### Phase-1 conception, design and implementation of the new structure idea ( Roads, Sidewalk, Outdoor space )

   - Work concentration in one manufacture to reduce carbon emission and control them with a Blockchain based solution[1] 
   - Pre-build module, square dimension style for quick setup installation or removal
   - Incorporation of a water draining system in all modules 
  
 **Ref[1]** ; *Most of major enterprise have signed an agreement itself implies that committing to the 2-degree limit will involve far more than just a transition to clean energy. The Ecological Footprint framework addresses climate change in a comprehensive way beyond measuring carbon emissions. It shows how carbon emissions compare and compete with other human demands on our planet, such as food, fibers, timber, and land for dwellings and roads.*

We want to change the road that are currently made of different derivated oil products, asphalt to recycled plastic module. This is of course a huge project, but because of the climate change and the population is growing, this could change some part of the world for a way better eco-system.

Right now, in every city, town or county, we all need road in good condition, outdoor space, but also road that can last longer than usual in every part of the world. To reduce carbon footprint in general we need to act quick or ( ASAP = As Soon As Possible ). 
The materiel that would be used is 100% recycable. Any plastic container or form of plastic could be used in this particular case. 


We could reduce carbon footprint emission by more than 50% but also have better road that could last longer than the usual with the new materiel used ( Recycled Plastics ). Those materiels used in the presend days like asphalt, gaz, oil, are not contributing in any way for a better eco-system and need to be remplaced quick or  ( ASAP = As Soon As Possible ). This is not even a question that we should think about and be more open about a new structure system. Right now we are draining the heart and we are not giving anything back in term of a compensation for a well balanced and an ideal eco-system.

Once the existing road asphalt removed, the pre-build module could be installed right away on a clean surface and last probably for years and years. At this stage, in a present data variable graphics we could demonstrate how this could be beneficial. I assume we could cut out around 50% of the total emission generated in relation with the asphalt pavage road right now and even much more over a period of time. 

### We can also start with small zone project : 

- Take a residential zonage area and go for a Beta project ( A years in test )
- Use pedestrian area and fill them up with integrated light in the recycled plastic modules
- Every car parking zone in the world, small medium and heavy residential as well as commercial could use those recycled modules

Assuming this project would work in cooperation with most of major city development industry and private sector, this could resume in a real emission change and sort of renewable energy because its 100% recyclable.

Assuming also the team that we are looking for this kind of project is really helping to create new job, diversification and even remote work for the engineering, design and many more role like promotion, public relations, media and such.
The impact would be signifiant. Less worker needed on site, less traffic on roads, less vehicules and machinery used, more online cooperation.  

Probably every single human on heart have walked by a plastic bottle laying on the floor somewhere, in the water or even in the garbage. Some have walked by hundred's on thousand's of these plastic bottles...Imagine...
